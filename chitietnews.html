				Enviroment is neccessary thing for this life. Enviroment is the air we breath, the water people drink and is everything they need for their life. But now the most important thing for the life is being polluted. This pollution affects the health of all living things. Air is damaged by lorry fumes and car, and power stations create acid rain which can destroys entire lakes and forests. When fossil fuels: gas, oil and coal are burned to provide energy for cooking, lighting etc. they form polluting gases. Not only on land but also in the sea, oils spills pollute sea water and kill marine life; chemical waste from sewage works and factories, and artificial fertilisers from farmland, pollute river water, spreading disease, and killing wildlife. Everything is being caused by human’s existence. Humans create rubbish! Each household produces about one tonne of rubbish each year! Most of this is taken away by dustmen and burned in incinerators or buried in enormous landfill sites – both of these actions can be dangerous for our environment.
				But only people can change and solve it. Pollution could be prevented by all thing we do each day. First people can use recycled paper to save trees. Second try to avoid using plastic. It is hard to recycle. People should refuse to use carrier bags. If people can not avoid buying plastic bags, they should use re-use plastic bags many times. Finally people must take their old clothes to charity shops. People also should save energy to protect environment. Switching off all electric things when they are not in use, walk or use a bicycle instead of car for short trips, keep healthy life and keep clean atmosphere.
